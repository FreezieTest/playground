Discord music bot supported with Slash Commands and Requests tracking. It has clean interface and is easy to run!  
Also has the main template function that I use in my personal bot.

 - install Python
 - `git clone https://github.com/freezpmark/music-discord-bot`
 - `cd music-discord-bot`

You have to create `.env` file in the root directory and set these variables:
```py
GUILD_ID=133713371337133713              # Your server ID
glados_TOKEN=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRS          # Your bot token
glados_ID=123456789012345678             # Your bot client ID
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS={"type": "...", ...}  # Google Sheets credendials
```
 - `python main.py`

There are also some optional variable settings you can set in `config.json`:
 - `timezone` (for request tracking)
 - `bots_settings["glados"]`:
   - `activity` (defines the status of the bot)
   - `cog_blacklist` (defines which cogs should be ignored)
