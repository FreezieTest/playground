Discord Music bot supported with Slash Commands and Requests tracking. It has clean interface and is easy to run!  
Also includes the main template function that I use in my personal bot.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage:
 - install Python
 - `git clone https://github.com/freezpmark/music-discord-bot`
 - `cd music-discord-bot`
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - You have to get Google Sheets credentials in json (tutorial for getting in [here](https://lcalcagni.medium.com/how-to-manipulate-google-spreadsheets-using-python-b15657e6ed0d))
 - You have to create `.env` file in the root directory and set these variables:
```py
GUILD_ID=133713371337133713              # Your server ID
glados_TOKEN=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPRS          # Your bot token
glados_ID=123456789012345678             # Your bot client ID
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS={"type": "...", ...}  # Your Google Sheets credendials in json
```
 - `python main.py`

There are also some optional variable settings you can set in `config.json`:
```json
{
    "timezone": "Europe/Vienna",  # for request tracking
    "bots_settings": {
        "glados": {
            "activity": "/play",  # defines the status of the bot
            "cog_blacklist": ["ai_algo", "korean"],  # defines which cogs should be ignored
            "prefix": "?"  # for commands that deal with request tracking
        },
    }
}
```
 - `timezone` (for request tracking)
 - `bots_settings["glados"]`:
   - `activity` (defines the status of the bot)
   - `cog_blacklist` (defines which cogs should be ignored)
   - `prefix` (for commands that deal with request tracking)

## üî• Features:
 - enables searching and playing tracks from YouTube
 - supports playing playlist or picking tracks from it
 - real-time audio player that is being updated before every track
 - button interactivity with the audio player
 - track request tracking system integrated with google sheets

## üëÄ Example
(There will be a gif file added soon that will showcase the usage)  

The app has not yet been fully tested and there are still a few TODOs to do in the code.
