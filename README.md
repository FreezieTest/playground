Provides interactive visualizations for text classification using the Naive Bayes Classifier‚Äã. It aims to demystify the inner workings of the algorithm, enabling users to gain deeper understanding of how it categorizes text documents. It serves as a tool for identifying instances when the algorithm's performance falls short. Frequently, it's quite challenging to pinpoint the reasons behind incorrect classifications, and the decision-making process driving predictions often remains obscured. It offers a window into the algorithm's decision-making process, illuminating these aspects and making them more transparent.
