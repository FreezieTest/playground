# music-discord-bot

!!!<img>!!!

Discord music bot supported with Slash Commands and Requests tracking. It has clean interface and is easy to run!  
Also has the main template function that I use in my personal bot.

In config.json you can set these parameters:
 - timezone (for request tracking)
 - bots_settings["glados"]:
   - activity (defines the status of the bot)
   - cog_blacklist (defines which cogs should be ignored)
   - prefix (for commands that deal with request tracking)

You have to create .env file in the root directory and set these variables:
 - GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
 - SERVER_ID
 - glados_TOKEN
 - glados_ID

```bash
TOKEN="." # Your bot token
PREFIX="!" # Your prefix
OWNER_IDS="859640640640640640, 859640640640640640" # Your ID
CLIENT_ID="960072976412340254" # Your bot client ID
GUILD_ID="859640640640640640" # Your server ID (if you want to use it for a single server)
PRODUCTION="true" # "true" for production
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://Blacky:xxxxxxxxxxxx" # Your MongoDB URL
LAVALINK_URL="lava.moebot.xyz:443" # Your lavalink url
LAVALINK_AUTH="youshallnotpass" # Your lavalink password
LAVALINK_NAME="Blacky" # Your lavalink name
LAVALINK_SECURE= "true" # true for secure lavalink
```
